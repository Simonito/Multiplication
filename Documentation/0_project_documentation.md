## Large number multiplication

Project description:

This project is being developed in Java in Eclipse IDE using standard libraries.

The program takes two numbers as an input and prints into the command line the multiplication product. The implementation uses the Karatsuba algorithm for effective multiplication. The program works with strigs and the multiplication (done by the java language) is for multiplying single digit numbers. This program also contains an implementation of addition and subtraction of strings, which is inspired by beatiful fellas at geeksforgeeks.org. The addition was inspired by Danish Raza's article: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-two-large-numbers/ 
who also written an article on large number subtraction: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-of-two-large-numbers/ on which the implementation is based on.
